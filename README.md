# 05 Work Day Scheduler

In this assignment, I was tasked to create a functional work day scheduler that I can insert projects that would save to local storage and persist afer a refresh. This assignment uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Moment()/Jquery/ and Bootstrap. The scheduler takes in the current time and displays the time blocks based off the current time. Past time block will be grey. Present time box will be red and future time blocks will be green.
